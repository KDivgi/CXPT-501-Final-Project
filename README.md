This repository has been created towards the completion of the Final Individual Project for CXPT 501 Biomedical Datascience.
This project involves the application of tools and techniques of python, its data visualization and analysis libararies, and biostatistics to clean, visualize, and analyze
data from a subset of the PIONEER-HF study dataset.

Study:    Comparison of Sacubitril/â€‹Valsartan Versus Enalapril on Effect on NT-proBNP in Patients Stabilized From an Acute Heart Failure Episode. (PIONEER-HF)
CTG link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02554890
This study investigates the effect of combination treatment initiation with sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril on time averaged proportional change in NT-proBNP.
The sample are patients who have been stabilized after hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.

Subfolders include:
1. Starting_Data - Contains the data saved as .csv files. DataFrames created after cleaning and removal of patients who do not meet Inclusion Critera are included.
2. Figures - Contains all generated figures.
3. Statistics - Contains all analyses conducted on the cleaned data.
4. Code - Contains the code used for visualization and analysis.
